---+ Thoughts and issues

---++ Wishlist:

  * Allow owner/user to overrule problems (notably undefined
    predicates).

  * Enhance author interface for updating packages.

  * Removing packages.  Notably, we need to keep track of the
    config files, so that we can delete them.  We can base that
    on config.done, which keeps track of where the file comes
    from.

  * Removing packages: warn about broken dependencies.  This
    probably needs a list of why a package is installed: one
    of
	- explicit
	- resolves_for(<pack>)

  * Signing.  Also make servers sign versions

  * Allow users to trust each other and/or allow them to
    give other users the right to update a repository.

---++ Git versioning issues

Currently, the cpack-mirror  is  a  _mirror_   repo  from  the  author's
repository. This means that a 'git fetch'   in  the cpack server updates
all heads forcefully to the author's  version.   There  are  a number of
scenarios that require attention:

---+++ The author submitted a broken version

One possible solution is to add a  tag   after  we do a pull. This would
allow us to step back using:

  ==
  git branch -f master <tag>
  ==

An alternative is to have a  branch   =cpack=,  which  is updated to the
desired branch or tag after the author   analysed the consistency of the
target point.

---+++ Dealing with local changes for users

Current approach does

  ==
  git fetch
  git merge origin/master
  ==

---++ Long term:

  * Rating system
  * Trust model
    - By reputation
    - By code analysis
