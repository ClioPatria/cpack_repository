---+ Thoughts and issues

Wishlist:

  * Allow owner/user to overrule problems (notably undefined
    predicates).
  * When updating/accepting a package, do some sanity checks
    first.
  * Removing packages.  Notably, we need to keep track of the
    config files, so that we can delete them.  We can base that
    on config.done, which keeps track of where the file comes
    from.
  * Removing packages: warn about broken dependencies.  This
    probably needs a list of why a package is installed: one
    of
	- explicit
	- resolves_for(<pack>)
  * Signing.  Also make servers sign versions
  * Clone servers.  Add fetching required clone-info to the
    API.

Long term:

  * Rating system
  * Trust model
    - By reputation
    - By code analysis
