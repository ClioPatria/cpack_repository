---+ Thoughts and issues

Wishlist:

  * Allow owner/user to overrule problems (notably undefined
    predicates).

  * When updating/accepting a package, do some sanity checks
    first.

      - Fetch into new branch (e.g. eval):

	  % git fetch origin master:eval
	  <evaluate, and if ok>
	  % git branch -M eval master

  * Removing packages.  Notably, we need to keep track of the
    config files, so that we can delete them.  We can base that
    on config.done, which keeps track of where the file comes
    from.

  * Removing packages: warn about broken dependencies.  This
    probably needs a list of why a package is installed: one
    of
	- explicit
	- resolves_for(<pack>)

  * Signing.  Also make servers sign versions

  * Allow users to trust each other and/or allow them to
    give other users the right to update a repository.

Long term:

  * Rating system
  * Trust model
    - By reputation
    - By code analysis
