<h1>CPACK: The ClioPatria package manager</h1>

<p>
Welcome to CPACK, the ClioPatria package manager. CPACK is a repository
to which packages can be uploaded. The server performs cross-reference
analysis to determine the dependencies between packages and validates
that all predicate and file requirements of the package are fullfilled,
either by Prolog, ClioPatria or some other package.
